# Print the return type
# You are debugging a package that you've been working on with your friends.\
# Something weird is happening with the data being returned from one of your functions,\
# but you're not even sure which function is causing the trouble.\
# You know that sometimes bugs can sneak into your code when you are expecting a function to return one thing,\
# and it returns something different. For instance, if you expect a function to return a numpy array, but it returns a list,\
# you can get unexpected behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide to write a decorator,\
# print_return_type(), that will print out the type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function it is decorating.

  # Define wrapper(), the decorated function

# Counter
# You're working on a new web app, and you are curious about how many times each of the functions in it gets called.\
# So you decide to write a decorator that adds a counter to each function that you decorate.\
# You could use this information in the future to determine whether there are sections of code\
# that you could remove because they are no longer being used by the app.
