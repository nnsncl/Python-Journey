# Three lists have been loaded into your session from a dataset that contains 720 Pokémon:

# The names list contains the names of each Pokémon.
# The primary_types list contains the corresponding primary type of each Pokémon.
# The secondary_types list contains the corresponding secondary type of each Pokémon (nan if the Pokémon has only one type).
# We want to combine each Pokémon's name and types together so that you easily see a description of each Pokémon. Practice using zip() to accomplish this task.


# Combine names and primary_types with zip()
names_type1 = [*zip(names, primary_types)]

print(*names_type1[:5], sep='\n')

# Combine all three lists together
names_types = [*zip(names, primary_types, secondary_types)]

print(*names_types[:5], sep='\n')

# Combine five items from names and three items from primary_types
differing_lengths = [*zip(names[0: 5], primary_types[0: 3])]

print(*differing_lengths, sep='\n')

# Collect the count of primary types
type_count = Counter(primary_types)
print(type_count, '\n')

# Collect the count of generations
gen_count = Counter(generations)
print(gen_count, '\n')

# Use list comprehension to get each Pokémon's starting letter
starting_letters = [name[0] for name in names]

# Collect the count of Pokémon for each starting_letter
starting_letters_count = Counter(starting_letters)
print(starting_letters_count)

# Import combinations from itertools
from itertools import combinations

# Create a combination object with pairs of Pokémon
combos_obj = combinations(pokemon, 2)
print(type(combos_obj), '\n')

# Convert combos_obj to a list by unpacking
combos_2 = [*combos_obj]
print(combos_2, '\n')

# Collect all possible combinations of 4 Pokémon directly into a list
combos_4 = [*combinations(pokemon, 4)]
print(combos_4)

# Convert both lists to sets
ash_set = set(ash_pokedex)
misty_set = set(misty_pokedex)

# Find the Pokémon that exist in both sets
both = ash_set.intersection(misty_set)
print(both)

# Find the Pokémon that Ash has and Misty does not have
ash_only = ash_set.difference(misty_set)
print(ash_only)

# Find the Pokémon that are in only one set (not both)
unique_to_set = ash_set.symmetric_difference(misty_set)
print(unique_to_set)
